# SwiftUI

SwiftUI reference projects, Beginner to Advance - From the SwiftUI Masterclass by Robert Petras.

1. Swift UI Async Image - Shows how async image can be used with different constructors like,
    scale: by default is 1, 
    transition: to add an animation, 
    content: Image, gives the image fetched from url
    content: AsyncImagePhase, can be switched upon success, failure and empty cases. AsyncImagePhase is a non frozen enum and can have future cases that need to be handled with an @unknown default to make the code future proof.

2. Restart - Learn how to use @AppStorage prooperty wrapper, set default value to it and how the @AppStorage updates the UI automatically if the key in UserDefaults changes.
    User of Animations withAnimation for transitions and looping an animation on a view, use of @State for changing the state of the application. Drage gesture and more 

3. Pinch - Basic one page application making user of tap gestures, pinch to zoom, drag gesture, double tap gesture, using cover image and scaling it with animations, changing the cover image using a side drawer.

4. Fruites - WIP
